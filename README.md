<h3>Centered Guides Script</h3>

While the scripts do not do mutch, they can save you considerable time by allowing you to create both vertical and horizontal guides at the very centre of the document using only a keyboard shortcut.

Installing and using them:

1. Copy both files to Adobe Photoshop/Presets/Scripts (restart photoshop if open).
2. Got to Edit > Edit Keyboard shorcuts and assign your preffered shorcut (you will find the two scripts under File > Scripts).


<h3>Save JPG</h3>

This script will save a JPG of your current file straight to your desktop and can be mapped to a shortcut. This means you can skip having to go through the same menu and selecting a location, which saved me a lot of time over the years.
